# Note
I am no longer actively working on this project. Building the site up to this point, the CRUD (Maybe not the DELETE part) is there. I have decided to move on as I think I have learnt enough when working on this project. My next project will play more to my interests (Game development, MMO games) and can also help me learn the same things. Thus, I am moving on from this project.

# Awesome Lists - Website
> Hosted at http://awesome.ravernkoh.me

Website for making and sharing awesome lists, which are collection of links to interesting things related to the list. It uses Phoenix, written in Elixir and uses Bootstrap 4.0 for the frontend design. Built by Ravern Koh.

## What are awesome lists?
Awesome lists are collections of links to (awesome) resources on the topic of the awesome list. So an awesome list on "Elixir" would have links to some of the best libraries, articles and videos on the topic. Awesome lists are not a new concept invented by me, many awesome lists already exist on GitHub.

## Motivation
I simply wanted a pet project to work on during my free time. This project seemed simple enough that I wouldn't be spending a few years trying to build this, but complex enough that I get to learn new things (stuff like photo upload, sending emails, etc.) while building this. At the time of starting this project, I have been learning Phoenix and Elixir for about 1 month, with only prior experience in NodeJS.
